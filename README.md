# FishingFinal
Project for CIS-125 2024

//Overview
This project is *technically* under the requirements it's just I am working on the fishing game currently.
(Uses CSV for I/O. Has prompts. Uses Classes. etc)

I have made a CSV tool that has basic utilities like Row or Column reading and such.

//MAIN MENU
For now just there is a main menu with the options:

1. Play (currently underdevelopment)
2. Fish dictionary (View the current list of fish and their details)
3. Exit (guess)

//GAME PLAY
The game will allow you to fish and randomly get a fish based off your bait and rod
Each fish will be caught based off their rarity which is pretty much their range in the size that they are at (ex. The small fries are most common in small fish where as trout are the most rare in their size rank)
These fish can be sold for their selling value in order to purchase better bait (Higher chance in catching rarity.), and rods (Higher chance in catching sized.)
